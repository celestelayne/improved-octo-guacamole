Coding for Spatial Practices - Fall 2021

### Course Description

Coding for Spatial Practices introduces students to web design and development as a means of representation, speculation and communication. Students will learn the foundational, front-end languages HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create work for the web browser.

To guide our study, we will explore questions such as: What is the relationship between architecture and the World Wide Web? What parallels can be drawn between the development process and our own design processes?

The class will consist of exercises and long-form projects which allow students to develop concepts, ideas, and strategies for web-based projects. These projects will be supplemented/contextualized by lectures, readings, writing, and student-led group discussions, to reinforce core concepts.
